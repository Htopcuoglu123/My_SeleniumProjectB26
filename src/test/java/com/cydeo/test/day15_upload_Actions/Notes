Q: How do we handle downloads using Selenium?

A:  - We do NOT. We can NOT handle(verify) downloads using only Selenium library.
    - We can click to a link on a browser page.
    - But once the file is downloaded, it will be out of scope for our selenium.


Q: How do we handle uploads using Selenium?

A:  - We can upload a file by simply passing the path of the file we want to upload.
    - We use sendKeys, and pass the "path" as a String into the WebElement that can upload.


- We just need to find the path of the file and pass it as a String.

Windows:

#1- Right click on the file
#2- Select "properties"
#3- Go to "Security" tab
#4- Get the path from "Object name"

For windows, either double backward "\\" or single forward "/" works.

String path ="C:\\Users\\hayat\\Desktop\\note.txt

Mac:

#1- Right click on the file
#2- Press and hold "option" button from keyboard
#3- Select "copy file as path name" option
#4- Paste into IntelliJ

Actions:
    - Actions class is used to handle "advanced" mouse and keyboard actions.
    - such as:
        - moveToElement
        - doubleClick
        - dragAndDrop
        - clickAndHold
        - contextClick
